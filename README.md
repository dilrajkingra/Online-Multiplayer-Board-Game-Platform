OMG — Online Multiplayer Board Game Platform

SENG 300 — Fall 2025

Project Description

OMG is an online multiplayer platform that allows players to play different classic board games such as Chess, Go, and Tic-Tac-Toe against each other. Users are able to create accounts, log in, view/update their profiles, queue for matchmaking, join private lobbies, play turns, view leaderboards, and communicate via in-game chat.
For this iteration, the focus is on requirements analysis, use cases, and establishing core architectural structure (service stubs, classes, and responsibilities). No real database or networking infrastructure is implemented yet — all external integration points are represented using internal stubs.

Technology and Constraints
	•	Language: Java (JDK 22)
	•	No external/non-standard libraries allowed (only standard Java)
	•	Version Control: University GitLab

Current Iteration Scope (Iteration 1)
	•	Understanding requirements and feature boundaries
	•	Creating initial architecture level class structure
	•	Use Case Descriptions (UC-1 to UC-8)
	•	Class Diagram (Platform + Core Services + Game Abstraction)
	•	Team roles and working agreements established
	•	Repo initialization and documentation foundation
